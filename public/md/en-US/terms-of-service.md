You assume all risks associated with Users with whom you come into contact. If you have any disputes or issues with any User, you agree to pursue any remedies directly with the applicable User, and you release Metaintro, its subsidiaries, and their respective employees, directors, and agents from all claims, demands, and damages of every kind (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

In the event that Metaintro suspends, limits, conditions, or terminates your access to the Services and/or your account due to your material breach of these Terms of Service or any other agreement that you have with Metaintro, you understand and accept that you will not receive a refund for any unused time with respect to fees that you have pre-paid for a subscription plan, product, or service.

### C. Payment Information; Taxes; Delinquent Payments

All information that you provide in connection with a monetary transaction must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also pay any applicable taxes relating to such transactions. If at any time Metaintro is required by a taxing authority to pay any taxes not previously collected from you, you will promptly submit such taxes (including applicable penalties and interest, if any) to Metaintro upon written notice.

Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (eighteen percent per annum) or the highest rate permitted by law, if less, from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Metaintro in collecting delinquent amounts, except where the delinquent amounts are due to billing inaccuracies. In addition, if you are late in payment of any fees, we reserve the right to either (i) immediately suspend or terminate your access to the applicable Services without notice, and in the event of any such suspension or termination, you will remain responsible for the entire amount of fees owing for such Services; or (ii) bill your credit/debit card on file with us under this or any other agreement. Unless your subscription plan is terminated timely and correctly, you will continue to accrue charges even if you don’t use the subscribed Services.

### D. Credit and Debit Cards

In the event that you pay for any Services using a credit card or debit card, you authorize Metaintro to charge your credit or debit card (or other acceptable payment method that you have chosen from those offered) ("Payment Method"), for the applicable fees for the duration of the applicable term of your selected subscription plan or other paid service or product, together with any applicable sales, use, excise, goods and services tax (GST), consumption, or other similar tax applicable to the Services. You represent that you are authorized to use the Payment Method on your company’s behalf, and you agree to accept an electronic record of a receipt. If at any time your Payment Method will not accept the charge for fees due, you agree that Metaintro may suspend or terminate your access to the applicable Services, and that you will continue to remain liable for the full payment for such Services even after your access to the Services has been terminated or suspended. By providing any Payment Method, you agree that applicable credit card, debit card, and billing information may be shared with third parties such as payment processors and credit agencies, and/or collection agencies for the purposes of checking your credit, effecting payment, collecting payments and late fees if applicable, and for providing the applicable Services to you or in order to enforce our agreement with you. We may also share this information with law enforcement authorities and in response to subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants.

## 12. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

These Terms of Service contains an Arbitration provision, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit disputes you have against Metaintro to binding and final arbitration to the extent that the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside permit the inclusion of Arbitration provision in these Terms of Service. You will only be permitted to pursue claims against Metaintro on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.

If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 12 is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:

A. Binding Arbitration

This Section 12 is referred to in these Terms of Service as the "Terms of Service to Arbitrate".Unless you opt-out pursuant to the opt-out procedures set forth below, you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Metaintro or its affiliates, whether relating to the Services, these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), or otherwise (each a "Dispute"), shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of these Terms of Service to Arbitrate. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party (“Notice”), by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required) or, in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail. Metaintro’s address for Notice is: Metaintro 1777 E39th St, #302, Denver, CO 80205. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Metaintro may commence an arbitration proceeding.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, each available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or such other alternative dispute resolution body and arbitration rules that may be mutually agreed upon by you and Metaintro. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by such rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Denver, Colorado, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, you and Metaintro may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

B. Restrictions

You and Metaintro agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Metaintro and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

C. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

You and Metaintro agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Metaintro intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.

D. 30 Day Right to Opt Out of Arbitration

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 12 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to [contact@metaintro.com](mailto:contact@metaintro.com). The notice must be sent to Metaintro within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these terms, whichever occurs first, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other provision and such invalid provision shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service.
