- Through email, SMS, chat or other online communications between you and Metaintro.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use, which terms are incorporated herein by this reference.

### 1. KEY TERMS

We use certain defined terms that appear in this specific Privacy Policy:

**Non-Personal Data:** Data that is not considered Personal Data under applicable law. We reserve the right to treat data as Personal Data or Non-Personal Data based on the law applicable to the data and the data subject.

**Personal Data:** Any information or pieces of information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you or your personal device either directly (e.g., your name) or, where required by applicable law indirectly (e.g., through pseudonymised data, such as a unique ID number). This means that Personal Data includes things like email/home addresses, usernames, user generated content, financial information, and health information. It could also include certain Technical Data (defined below) such as unique numerical identifiers like your computer’s IP address or your mobile device’s MAC address, as well as cookies (“Device IDs”), where required by applicable law.

**Special Categories of Personal Data:** Sensitive Personal Data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership; genetic and biometric data; and data concerning health, sex life or sexual orientation.

### 2. DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

### 6. HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT

Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to, the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting, and/or regulatory obligations in relation to that Personal Data (e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations), whether our relationship with you is ongoing (e.g., where you use more than one of our products and/or services), any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights (e.g., the defense of any claims). In some circumstances, we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.

Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain or securely delete or destroy your Personal Data subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.

### 7. YOUR DATA SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS

We respect your privacy rights and provide you with reasonable access and rights to the Personal Data that you may have provided through your use of the Services, in accordance with applicable law.

A. Data Subject Rights
Depending on applicable law, you may have the following rights with respect to your Personal Data:

- Right to Information: The right to know whether we process Personal Data about you and, if so, what Personal Data we hold about you and how we use it.
- Right of Access: The right to be provided with a copy of your Personal Data (subject to certain restrictions under applicable law).
- Right to Delete: The right to request that we delete your Personal Data (subject to certain restrictions under applicable law).
- Right of Rectification: The right to require us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. If you have a user account with us, you also have the option of correcting your information directly in your account.

Right to withdraw consent at any time: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Right to opt out of sale/targeted advertising: You have the right to opt-out of the sales of your Personal Data or the processing of your Personal Data for purposes of targeted advertising.

If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the above (each, an \`Access Request\`), please send an email to [admin@metaintro.com](mailto:admin@metaintro.com) with your specific request and identify the specific website to which your request relates. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Once we receive your request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If we are not clear as to what you are requesting, we may also need to contact you for clarification so we can more fully respond to your request.

If we cannot locate any records about you, we may also ask you for additional information to assist us in locating records, if they exist.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within the timeframes required under applicable law. Occasionally it may take us longer than the time period required under applicable law if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you as to the reason for the delay.

B. Deleting Your Account
If you would like to delete your account, you can send an email to [admin@metaintro.com](mailto:admin@metaintro.com)asking for your account to be deleted. If you close or delete your account, we may still retain certain information for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce our Terms of Use or other policies, take actions we deem necessary due to technical and legal requirements, and as dictated by constraints related to the security, integrity, and operation of our Services.
